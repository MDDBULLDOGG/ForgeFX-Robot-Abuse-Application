# ForgeFX-Robot-Abuse-Application

This mini-project takes a model with children and allows the user to 'attach' and 'detach' it's children to a defined 'root'. Additionally, the UI tracks the attachment status of all limbs.

In this example, you can pick apart all limbs and 'subcomponents' of an Iron Giant model.
